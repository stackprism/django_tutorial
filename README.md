================
This is a Django+Puppet+AWS setup Joseph Reynolds, <reynoldsjoseph.f@gmail.com> , and Ben Donaldson, <2468ben@gmail.com> , are working on, to get ourselves more familiar with Django & Puppet (coming from Rails & Chef).

We'll be listing all the steps we take, as we go from installing by hand to using a build system, in a file called "process.md".
